Our author, in his oration sor Deiotatus, ihm speaks
of tho disadvanmge of speaking before a small
audienoe: ⁶⁴1 am piending within the walls of a
waning-house, deprived of that assembly and those
numbers stom which Eloquence derives her spirit.

endeavors to obtain ,justicd ihough they have but an
inconsiderable effect upon the emotions of the mind,
and contribute but little towards the energy and
force os eloquenee. For were Ι, sir, to plead this
cause in the sorum, in you: hearing and iat* your

tribunal, with what spirit would the assembied
crowds of Romans inspiro me ! '¹
