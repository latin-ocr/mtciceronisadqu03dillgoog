gmon, adopted from those of Groeoe, oonsisoed
of tmgedieS, comedieS, and satiras, represented at
the theatro in honor of Bacchus), venua, and Apollo.
To render these exhibitions more anrhctive to the
common people, they were accompanied by rope·
dancing, tumbling, and similar pedm-mances, Aster-

83. 13. Consilium This word—in some editions
concilium — means here the assembly consulting to-
gether, not the subject of consultation.

84. 23. Sibi illum consulem, The whole of this

was boldly upbmiding the senate for their supine·
nese, and deelaring that the times demanded a
better senatu he went so far as to order a con-
fiscation of the goods of L. Crassus, a man of gmut
dignity and eloquenoe‚ for expressing his indigna-
tion at these remarks. Crassus, thrusting aeide the
lictor, exclaimed, “l no longer regard you as a

consul, fhilip, because you do not rogard me as a
temtor.
